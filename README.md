# University Final Project

## Description

This project is a system to track information about university classes, teachers, and students. It allows for managing both full-time and part-time teachers, students, and classes.

### Features``

- **Teachers**:
  - **Full-time**: Base salary multiplied by 110% of years of experience.
  - **Part-time**: Base salary multiplied by active hours per week.

- **Students**: Basic information including name, ID, and age.

- **Classes**: Each class has a name, an assigned classroom, a list of students, and a teacher.

1. Initialize at least 2 teachers of each type (full-time and part-time).
2. Initialize at least 6 different students.
3. Initialize at least 4 different classes, including their teachers, students, and other relevant data.
4. Print a menu with the following options:
   - a. Print all professors with their data.
   - b. Print all classes and a submenu to select a class in order to print the class data, including its teacher and students.
   - c. Create a new student and add them to an existing class.
   - d. Create a new class and add an existing teacher, existing students, and relevant data.
   - e. List all the classes in which a given student is included (hint: search by ID).
   - f. Exit.
